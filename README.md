# Vue TypeScript Sandbox

I started playing around with this because I wanted to try to make Vue look more like
React + Flow and ended up making a better Angular 2.

Hopefully this helps some folks looking to do something similar. I actually prefer
Vue with TypeScript (using classes and decorators) over the regular syntax.

I started just adding random components, somewhat inspired by [7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis).

### Components vs Primitives

A Primitive is a Vue file without any state or logic. It's a template with some
styles ready to be passed data.

### TODO:
  - [] Write better docs? Maybe?
  - [] Replace HTML templates with Pug
  - [] Something with D3 because D3
  - [] Add data grid/table example
  - [] Add rich text editor (i.e., DraftJS)
  - [] Go through Bootstrap/Materialize and find other neat components
